# Task Scheduler Project

Welcome to the **Task Scheduler** project! This project is designed to provide a task management system where users can schedule, track, and manage their tasks effectively. It consists of two main parts: a **frontend** application and a **backend** server.

This repository is organized into two separate directories:

- **Frontend**: The user interface for interacting with the task management system.
- **Backend**: The API server that powers the task scheduling logic and handles data management.
